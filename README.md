## üöÄ Setup Tailscale and Rustdesk with Docker Compose

This project provides a simple way to run Tailscale and Rustdesk server components using Docker Compose.

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed
- Register a Tailscale account and get your authentication key ([see Tailscale auth key docs](https://tailscale.com/kb/1085/auth-keys/))
- Install Tailscale on your client remote desktop devices ([download Tailscale apps](https://tailscale.com/download))
- A `.env` file with your Tailscale authentication details (see Tailscale docs)

### üì¶ Services
- **tailscale**: Provides secure networking for your containers and devices.
- **hbbs**: Rustdesk relay server (for NAT traversal and relaying connections).
- **hbbr**: Rustdesk rendezvous server (for peer discovery and connection setup).

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Create a `.env` file with your Tailscale environment variables (see [Tailscale docs](https://tailscale.com/kb/1085/docker/)).
3. Start all services:
   ```powershell
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. (Optional) Check logs for each service:
   ```powershell
   docker compose logs tailscale
   docker compose logs hbbs
   docker compose logs hbbr
   ```
5. To get the Rustdesk server key, check the logs of the `hbbs` service after it starts:
   ```powershell
   docker compose logs hbbs
   ```
   Look for a line containing `key=...` in the output. This is the key you will use to connect Rustdesk clients to your server.

### üîå Ports
- Rustdesk HBBS: 21115, 21116, 21118
- Rustdesk HBBR: 21117

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes
- Tailscale runs in host network mode and requires elevated privileges (NET_ADMIN, SYS_MODULE).
- Data for Tailscale is persisted in the `./tailscale` directory. If you want to keep the directory tracked by git but ignore its contents, a `.gitkeep` file is included and `.gitignore` is configured accordingly.
